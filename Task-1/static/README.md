RAG Pipeline Web Interface - CSS & JavaScript
This repository contains the CSS and JavaScript files for the web interface of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline project. The frontend interacts with the backend to handle tasks such as file uploads, query processing, and displaying results retrieved from the RAG pipeline.

Overview
The CSS and JavaScript files are responsible for the layout, styling, and dynamic functionality of the web pages. These files ensure that the user interface is visually appealing, responsive, and interactive.

CSS Files
The CSS files are located in the static/css/ folder. They define the styling and appearance of the web pages.

Files
styles.css
This file contains the primary styling for the web interface, including layout, typography, and colors.
Key Features:
General Styles: Basic layout, background colors, and font settings.
Responsive Design: Ensures that the page is usable across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Form Styles: Customizes the appearance of input fields, buttons, and forms for file uploads and query submission.
Error and Success Messages: Adds visual cues for displaying success or error messages to the user.
Loading Indicators: Styles for displaying a loading spinner or progress bar while data is being processed.
How to Modify
You can adjust the layout and colors by editing the .css classes.
For adding new sections (e.g., custom pop-ups or modals), you can define new styles in this file.
JavaScript Files
The JavaScript files are located in the static/js/ folder. They handle the dynamic behavior of the web interface, including making API calls, managing form submissions, and rendering results.

Files
script.js
This file contains the logic for the following tasks:
File Upload Handling: Sends the uploaded PDF files to the backend for processing using AJAX.
Query Handling: Submits the user's query (text) to the backend and handles the response for displaying it dynamically.
Error Handling: Captures errors (such as invalid file uploads or empty queries) and displays appropriate messages to the user.
Loading States: Manages loading indicators during file uploads or query processing.
Dynamic Content Rendering: Once the backend processes the query, this script injects the response into the HTML page.
How to Modify
You can modify the event handlers for file uploads or query submissions to customize the interactions.
The AJAX logic can be updated if the API endpoint changes or if additional features are added (e.g., showing results in a specific format like tables or charts).
The script is designed to handle responses dynamically, meaning it will automatically update the page content without a full reload.
How to Use
CSS:

Ensure that the styles.css file is linked to the HTML files inside the <head> tag.
Any custom styles can be added to the CSS file.
JavaScript:

Link the script.js file in your HTML template right before the closing </body> tag.
Modify the script.js file to customize the form submission, error handling, or dynamic data rendering as per the application's requirements.
