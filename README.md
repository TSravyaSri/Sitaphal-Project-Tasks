Task 1: Chat with PDF Using RAG Pipeline 

Overview:

The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to 
interact with semi-structured data in multiple PDF files. The system should extract, chunk, 
embed, and store the data for e icient retrieval. It will answer user queries and perform 
comparisons accurately, leveraging the selected LLM model for generating responses. 

Functional Requirements:

1.Data Ingestion:
  Input: PDF files containing semi-structured data.
  Process: 
   Extract text and relevant structured information from PDF files. 
   Segment data into logical chunks for better granularity. 
   Convert chunks into vector embeddings using a pre-trained embedding model. 
   Store embeddings in a vector database for e icient similarity-based retrieval. 

2.Query Handling:
  Input: User's natural language question. 
  Process: 
   Convert the user's query into vector embeddings using the same embedding 
model. 
   Perform a similarity search in the vector database to retrieve the most relevant 
chunks.
   Pass the retrieved chunks to the LLM along with a prompt or agentic context to 
generate a detailed response. 

3.Comparison Queries 
  Input: User's query asking for a comparison  
  Process: 
   Identify and extract the relevant terms or fields to compare across multiple PDF 
files. 
   Retrieve the corresponding chunks from the vector database. 
   Process and aggregate data for comparison. 
   Generate a structured response (e.g., tabular or bullet-point format). 

4.Response Generation:
  Input: Relevant information retrieved from the vector database and the user query. 
  Process: 
   Use the LLM with retrieval-augmented prompts to produce responses with exact 
values and context. 
   Ensure factuality by incorporating retrieved data directly into the response. 

Example Data: 

https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/dolciani/pdf_files/workshop-materials/mmc
presentations/tables-charts-and-graphs-with-examples-from.pdf 

Extract accurate information: 

1. From page 2 get the exact unemployment information based on type of degree input 
2. From page 6 get the tabular data  

Task 2: Chat with Website Using RAG Pipeline 

Overview: 

The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to 
interact with structured and unstructured data extracted from websites. The system will crawl, 
scrape, and store website content, convert it into embeddings, and store it in a vector database.Users can query the system for information and receive accurate, context-rich responses generated by a selected LLM. 

Functional Requirements: 

1.Data Ingestion:
  Input: URLs or list of websites to crawl/scrape. 
  Process: 
   Crawl and scrape content from target websites. 
   Extract key data fields, metadata, and textual content. 
   Segment content into chunks for better granularity. 
   Convert chunks into vector embeddings using a pre-trained embedding model. 
   Store embeddings in a vector database with associated metadata for e icient 
retrieval. 

2.Query Handling:
  Input: User's natural language question. 
  Process:  
   Convert the user's query into vector embeddings using the same embedding 
model. 
   Perform a similarity search in the vector database to retrieve the most relevant 
chunks. 
   Pass the retrieved chunks to the LLM along with a prompt or agentic context to 
generate a detailed response.

3.Response Generation:
  Input: Relevant information retrieved from the vector database and the user query. 
  Process: 
   Use the LLM with retrieval-augmented prompts to produce responses with exact 
values and context. 
   Ensure factuality by incorporating retrieved data directly into the response.
